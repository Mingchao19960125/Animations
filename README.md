# Animations
make animations of doppio and gomofs model 

Developed originally by JiM and his interns Lei Zhao and Mingchao in 2019-2020 but still needs a lot of cleaning, simplifying, and documenting.  For example, it calls a function called "seperate" which creates a dictionary of emolt observation positions to overlay on the images.  This is not critial to making model animations and probably should be removed or simplified.
